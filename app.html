  <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
  <p>
    <b>How the Web Works</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
    each other. When a person goes to a web page like
    www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em>
    to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate
    HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where
    a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it
    on the user's screen.

    does a good job of explaining more.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>HTML</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML
    documents form the majority of the content on the web.
    HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes
    "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it
    looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a>
    gives a good overview.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
    writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element
    by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
    explains the distinction well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
    literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small
    mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
    Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
    content inside of them.
  </p>
  <h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
    Block elements form an "invisible box" around the
    content inside of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
    elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
    draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had
    multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
    <br>
    In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of
    nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of
    boxes, and so on...
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave
    of changing indentations going up and down the left side
    of the document. The more indented an element is, the more
    deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Text Editors (for programming)</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like
    Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's
    life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically
    generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
