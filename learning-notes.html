			<p><b>Thinking like a Programmer</b>
			<p>A large goal of this Nanodegree is to give you practice thinking like a computer programmer.</p>

			<p><b>1. Procedural Thinking</b></p>
			<p>
			Procedural thinking involves
			creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions
			for a computer to follow.<br>

			It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards,
			but getting a computer to do that requires more thought.
			But once you've learned to think this way
			you'll find that computers can do it much faster.
			</p>

			<p><b>2. Abstract Thinking</b></p>
			<p>
			Abstract thinking means
			finding similarity,
			or as programmers would say,
			generality amongst seemingly different things.<br>

			The Udacity programmers
			used the power of what's called abstraction
			to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.
			</p>

			<p><b>3. Systems Thinking</b></p>
			<p>
			Systems thinking happens
			when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.<br>

			Programmers do this
			when they create a plan (often on paper)
			for how a program will work.<br>

			It involves big-picture thinking
			and decision-making about a problem
			and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.<br>
			</p>


			<p><b>4. Technological Empathy</b></p>
			<p>
			For example,
			computer empathy is
			the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works,
			and what it's good and bad at doing.<br>

			A computer is a tool,
			as are the programs we use
			and the programming languages used to write them.<br>
			</p>


			<p><b>5. Debugging</b></p>
			<p>				
			Debugging is a systematic process of
			relentlessly identifying the cause
			of a computer program that doesn't work.<br>

			When a program doesn't work,
			it's because there is a mistake (also known as a "bug") somewhere in the computer code.
			<br>

			Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming,
			every good programmer has a system for fixing them
			and that system usually looks something like this:<br>
			Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)<br>
			Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)<br>
			Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)<br>
			Fix the problem
