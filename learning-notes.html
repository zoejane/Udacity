<br>
A large goal of this Nanodegree is
to give you practice thinking like a computer programmer.<br>

<h2>1. Procedural Thinking</h2>

Procedural thinking involves
creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions
for a computer to follow.<br>

It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards,
but getting a computer to do that requires more thought.
But once you've learned to think this way
you'll find that computers can do it much faster.

<h2>2. Abstract Thinking</h2>

Abstract thinking means
finding similarity,
or as programmers would say,
generality amongst seemingly different things.<br>

The Udacity programmers
used the power of what's called abstraction
to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.

<h2>3. Systems Thinking</h2>

Systems thinking happens
when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.<br>

Programmers do this
when they create a plan (often on paper)
for how a program will work.<br>

It involves big-picture thinking
and decision-making about a problem
and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.<br>


<h2>4. Technological Empathy</h2>


For example,
computer empathy is
the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works,
and what it's good and bad at doing.<br>

A computer is a tool,
as are the programs we use
and the programming languages used to write them.<br>


<h2>5. Debugging</h2>

Debugging is a systematic process of
relentlessly identifying the cause
of a computer program that doesn't work.<br>

When a program doesn't work,
it's because there is a mistake (also known as a "bug") somewhere in the computer code.
<br>

Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming,
every good programmer has a system for fixing them
and that system usually looks something like this:<br>
Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)<br>
Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)<br>
Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)<br>
Fix the problem
